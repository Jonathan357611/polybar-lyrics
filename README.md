Demonstrated using lyrics from Without me - Eminem.

## Installation ðŸ’¿


1. Clone the Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jonathan357611/polybar-lyrics
    cd polybar-lyrics
    ```
2. Get spotify credentials:

    Go to the [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
    and click on "Create an App" and select a name and description.
    After that, you should see your App's dashboard, click on "Edit Settings"
    and add "http://127.0.0.1/callback" to the redirect URIs. Save that.

3. Set credentials:

    After step 2, paste the Client ID, Client Secret and your spotify username in polybar-lyrics.py, you should get these informations on the App Dashboard.
    Line 10-12 should look something like this:
    ```python
    USERNAME = "John_Doe"  # Put your Spotify username here
    CLIEND_ID = "3450345073645sdfsdf0763"  # Here your Client ID
    CLIENT_SECRET = "8345897s78734587ds7h87fgh7096"  # And client secret
    ```
    of course filled in with your credentials ;)

4. Polybar Config:
    
    Paste this in your polybar-config
    ```ini
    [module/polybar-lyrics]
    type=custom/script
    exec = python3 <path to polybar-lyrics.py>
    interval=0.1
    ```

5. Initial start:

    **IMPORTANT:**
    You should run the script yourself as an initial setup.
    Execute it like this:
    ```bash
    python3 polybar-lyrics.py
    ```
    It should redirect you to a login screen. Login.
    The script should ask you for the URL your beeing redirect to after the Login. Paste it there and press enter.

    You should have a file called .cache-\<username\> (Use ```ls -a```) . Paste that to your home directory (~)

6. Done

    Everything should now be setup, just add the module to your bar and your ready to go!
